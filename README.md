##How to run meas.sh for SSID-RSSI measurements in Terminal (NOTE: DON"T do this using a public computer!!!)
  1. Navigate to "automeasure" file directory: `cd /Users/automeasure/`
  2. Set permission for all files to be readable, writable, executable: `chmod777 meas.sh`
  3. Run file: `./meas.sh`
  
  Output will be in "automeasure" folder consisting of 5 *.txt* files in 28 second interval (autostop)
  
###Then, measurement of location is continued in the Jupyter Notebook (*.ipynb*)
